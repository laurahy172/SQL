Relevant Definitions:
`Normalization`: Standardizing or “cleaning up a column” by transforming it in some way to make it ready for analysis. A few normalization techniques are below:
- Adjusting a column that includes multiple currencies to one common currency
- Adjusting the varied distribution of a column value by transforming it into a z-score
- Converting all price into a common metric (e.g., price per ounce)
